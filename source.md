# Viet Duc Nguyen

Hi! I’m a mathematics student who enjoys attending hackathons and writing software. I was a proud *Cal bear* in 2021, but now I am a *Bear*liner again (haha).

I like functional analysis, distribution theory, integration theory. I am writing a thesis about the *Hairer-Caravenna-Zambotti reconstruction theorem* under the supervision of [Prof. Friz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Friz).

I am passionate about Swift (although Objective-C will always have a special place in my heart ❤️), Typescript and React.

Currently, I am a writing react apps and backend solutions for [Mind Intelligence](https://www.mindintelligence.io). I also do UX stuff for them.

## FAQ

**Why do you have two bachelor degress?**

I liked math so much that I wanted to study it after I completed my bachelor's in computer science. In fact, I always wanted to study both.
